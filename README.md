# 🍽️ FoodBot App

**FoodBot** is an Android mobile application designed to help users discover restaurants and meals based on their dietary preferences and allergies. The app aims to improve the restaurant experience by reducing the need to ask waiters for ingredient details or menu recommendations. Users can interact with a built-in chatbot to get instant answers about meals, ingredients, and restaurant options.
